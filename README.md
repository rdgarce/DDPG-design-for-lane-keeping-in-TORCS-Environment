# 🏎 DDPG design for lane keeping in TORCS Environment
My absolutely first repository on github!

This repository contains my bachelor's degree thesis project: Designing a DDPG algorithm for approaching the lane keeping problem in the autonomous ground vehicle driving.
I used Python with keras and tensorflow for working with neural networks and TORCS as the environment in which the experiment took place.

## Structure
The work is structured as follows.
```
├── Code #The main folder of all the code of the experiment
│   ├── DDPG #Folder containing all the classes and functions for implementing the algo.
│   │   ├── OU.py #Implementation of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise with the stochastic brake mod
│   │   ├── GN.py #Implementation of the Gaussian Noise
│   │   ├── TVNoise.py #Implementation of the Time Variant Noise
│   │   ├── conditioning.py #Implementation of a utility function for interacting with TORCS env.
│   │   ├── networks.py #Implementation of Actor and Critic networks
│   │   ├── replayBuffer.py #Implementation of the experience replay required by DDPG
│   │   ├── reward.py #Implementation of the three env. reward functions
│   │   ├── config.py #Config file you need to look before running any experiment with DDPG
│   │   └── agent.py #Implementation of the agent class and all of its functions
│   ├── Client.py #Main python script to launch the experiment
│   └── snakeoil.py #Implementation of the client interface for the interaction with TORCS game
└── Docs #Folder containing documents
    ├── Tesi.pdf #Thesis on DDPG design for lane keeping in TORCS Environment. Italian language
    └── latex_template #Latex template folder of my thesis project
