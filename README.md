# 🏎 DDPG design for lane keeping in TORCS Environment
My absolutely first repository on github!

This repository contains my bachelor's degree thesis project: Designing a DDPG algorithm for approaching the lane keeping problem in the autonomous ground vehicle driving.

## Pre-requisites
- Python with Keras and Tensorflow
- TORCS game with SCR patch

## Structure
The work is structured as follows.
